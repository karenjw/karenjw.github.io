					<p>Blending speed, versatility, and image quality, the silver Nikon 1 J5 is a sleek mirrorless digital camera designed for the multimedia photographer on-the-go. Featuring a 20.8MP CX-format BSI CMOS sensor and EXPEED 5A image processor, the J5 is capable of recording up to 20 fps with continuous autofocus as well as UHD 2160p/15 or Full HD 1080p/60 video. A top sensitivity of ISO 12800 benefits working in difficult lighting conditions while the BSI design of sensor helps to achieve greater image clarity with reduced noise levels and the omission of an optical low-pass filter further contributes to a high degree of sharpness and resolution. Complementing the imaging assets, the 1 J5 is also characterized by a revamped, retro-inspired body design featuring a 3.0" 1,037k-dot touchscreen LCD that tilts 180° upward for prime selfie compositions. Additionally, snapbridge Wi-Fi connectivity with NFC also allows for instant wireless image sharing and remote camera control from mobile devices.</p>
					<p>Complementing the imaging capabilities, the 1 J5's speed is further carried over to the hybrid focusing system that utilizes both contrast- and phase-detection methods for greater accuracy and subject tracking performance. A dedicated Sport Mode helps to optimize camera settings for faster, more intuitive handling and, in contrast, in-camera time lapse shooting is also possible.</p>
					<p>Included with the camera body is the 1 NIKKOR VR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 PD-ZOOM lens, which provides a 27-81mm equivalent focal length range. This wide-angle to short-telephoto lens features a Power-Drive zoom mechanism, for quick, smooth control and VR image stabilization to suppress the effects of camera shake.</p>

								<h2>Capture sights other cameras miss</h2>
								<p>The Nikon 1 J5 achieves a level of speed and accuracy not even a DSLR can match. Its cutting-edge autofocus system uses 105 phase-detect AF points to instantly identify and focus on your subject. Hold down the shutter button and turn each second of action into 20 tack-sharp, full-resolution photos. Fix your focus, and the Nikon 1 J5 can capture at a mind boggling 60 frames per second continuously.</p>

					<h3>20.8MP BSI CMOS Sensor and EXPEED 5A Image Processor</h3>
					<p>The 20.8MP CX-format BSI CMOS sensor pairs with an enhanced EXPEED 5A image processor to realize high-resolution still shooting and movie recording with native sensitivity to ISO 12800. The BSI design of the sensor helps to minimize noise and maintain true image clarity when working in difficult lighting conditions and High ISO Noise Reduction composites four separate images into a single frame for sharp and clean results. Additionally, the sensor's design also omits an optical low-pass filter in order to achieve high image sharpness and resolution.</p>
					<p>The combination of the sensor and processor also affords a wealth of speed throughout the camera system, including the ability to shoot at 20 fps with continuous autofocus or 60 fps with fixed focus, and a unique Sports Mode optimizes camera settings for fast action and quick switching between shooting scenarios.</p>
					<p>This speed also carries over to the video recording side, where, in addition to UHD 2160p/15 and Full HD 1080p/60 recording, you can shoot high-speed HD 720p movies at 120 fps or 400 x 144 movies at 1200 fps. Simultaneous still recording for up to 20 frames is possible and in-camera Electronic Vibration Reduction is available when recording at 30p or 60p. A built-in interval timer permits making time lapse movies, as well.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card">
					<h3>Hybrid Autofocus</h3>
					<p>Blending both phase- and contrast-detection autofocus systems, the 1 J5 utilizes 171 distinct areas to quickly and accurately achieve focus. Of these 171 areas, the center 105 areas support phase-detection focusing for faster response time and improved subject tracking to benefit working in fast-paced shooting conditions.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card">
					<h3>Body Design</h3>
					<p>Characterized by a sleek and retro-inspired design, the compact profile includes a range of control dials, customizable function buttons, and a large 3.0" 1,037k-dot LCD monitor. The LCD features a 180° tilting design for self-portraits and is also a touchscreen for more intuitive control over camera settings, menu navigation, and playback.</p>
					<p>While compact in size, the CX format of the 1 J5 also affords compatibility with a wide range of lenses. Besides native 1-series lenses, the camera can also be paired with the optional FT1 mount adapter for working with any F mount lens with maintained VR and autofocus.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="card">
					<h3>Snapbridge Wi-Fi Connectivity with NFC</h3>
					<p>Supporting a wealth of sharing and tagging possibilities, the 1 J5 features built-in snapbridge Wi-Fi connectivity to enable seamless transfer of imagery as well as remote shooting capabilities. Once the Nikon Wireless Mobile Utility app has been installed on an Android or iOS mobile device, you can use that device to browse the contents of the memory card, select images, and seamlessly transfer files between devices for immediate sharing online. Additionally, the mobile device can remotely trigger the shutter and display a live view image from the camera to enable working from a distance. NFC (Near Field Communication) is also supported to provide a quick and simple tap-to-connect method for linking your mobile devices with the camera.</p>

					<h3>1 NIKKOR VR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 PD-ZOOM Lens</h3>
					<p>Included with the camera body is the versatile 1 NIKKOR VR 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 PD-ZOOM lens; a wide-angle to portrait-length zoom providing a 27-81mm equivalent focal length range. The Power-Drive zoom mechanism affords smooth and precise control over the zoom placement, making it ideal for use when recording videos. Built-in VR image stabilization works to minimize the appearance of camera shake to benefit working with longer shutter speeds. Additionally, the lens' compact form factor is complemented by a built-in lens cover, alleviating the need for a lens cap.</p>
