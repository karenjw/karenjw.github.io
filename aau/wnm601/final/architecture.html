				<div class="slide-desc">Geisel Library is the main library building of the University of California, San Diego Library. It is named in honor of Audrey and Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss. The building's distinctive Brutalist architecture have resulted in its being featured in the UC San Diego logo and becoming the most recognizable building on campus.</div>

				<div class="slide-desc">The library is a concrete and glass structure in the Brutalist style. It is comprised of 8 levels, with the center tower reaching 110 feet in height. The general library collection is contained in the five-level building raised above a two-level platform. The building is supported by sixteen external concrete trusses, which were originally designed to be inside, but were moved outside in order to increase useable space. Like a ziggurat temple, the floors are stepped. Of the eight levels, the lowest level is subterranean and levels two and three create the dramatic separation between the ground plane and the elevated sphere. Level six, with the most reader stations, is the widest, with level four equaling level eight and level five equaling level seven. The center tower is where all the books are stores, leaving the surrounding windows open to reading space.</div>

				<div class="slide-desc">Do Ho Suh's Fallen Star is the 18th permanent sculpture commissioned by UCSD's Stuart Collection. It reflects Suh's on-going exploration of themes around the idea of home, cultural displacement, the perception of our surroundings, and how one constructs a memory of a space.</div>
